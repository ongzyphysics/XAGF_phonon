This is the Matlab/Octave code for the Extended Atomistic Green's Function (XAGF) method. It is based on my 2015 and 2018 papers on extensions to the traditional Atomistic Green's Function methodology for studying ballistic phonon transport. The new methodology enables the calculation of mode-resolved scattering amplitudes (transmission and reflection) in quasi-1D nanostructures such the the intermolecular junction between carbon nanotubes.
